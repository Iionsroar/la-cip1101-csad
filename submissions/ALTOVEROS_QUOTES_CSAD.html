Childhood Years, 

  I was a plain mischievous thing who knew nothing but to cry at every turn
  of the moment.1 I was so scared of being left alone and was always dependent upon the presence of people I know.2 I was very fond of small toys and had tons of them.3 These objects were usually of vanity, as all I did was to have my figurines fight or have my cars crash at each other.4 My early years was almost devoid of relevant hobbies.5 It was a catastrophic era of toys and endless playing after all.6 I had a lot of fun though.7 And I think I developed a meaningful sense of social connectivity to the kids I played with.8 There was no awkward moments.9 Just disappointments and limitations to play freedom.10 But it all helped me form a bright character out of the fragility of my soul.11 Like the toys I play with, I get into silly fights and ignore people.12 I was very picky with foods too!13 I remember doing nothing but cause trouble to my family.14 Indeed, I was the reincarnation of trouble and accidents.15 I ride the bike and crash near a canal.16 I have dropped and broken several crockeries.17 My relatives know me as the kid who always does something wrong and never eats healthy food.18 It was a huge leap, looking back.19 But I had plenty of fun being all about play and exploration!20 

Teenage Years, 

  It was uncomfortable how unusual I looked with small, noticeable hairs under my nose and chin.1 I suppose this was the catalyst of my shyness and awkwardness.2 I fondly recall hiding the lower half of my face behind a towel every time I go outside, especially in school.3 I felt like a small and unnoticeable existence.4 I might as well associate myself with the cavemans with how I move.5 The thing is, I seldom moved around!6 As a child I loved being everywhere and getting wounds here and there.7 Boy I was shocked to find myself acting like a rock despite how the world around me moves nonstop.8 I find it hard being me without being a kid.9 Everyone was intimidating and responsible-looking like the adults.10 But my classmates were extremely friendly and it was just me being embarassed for my looks.11 The years went on and I was the same silent kid but I learned a lot and started getting into social circles.12 School was difficult and I found it hard it manage my time.13 When I am not studying I am playing, trying to get back to the kind of life I recall.14 But this time with online games.15 My home environment was full of computers and gamers.16 It didn't take me long to become part of the "unproductive" community.17 And so I did not have any more exploration and was stuck in a common loop.18 It was a bit late when I broke out of it and I missed so much of life.19 But I loved exploration and thinking about the immediate future kept me moving forward!20

College Years

  Contrary to my fears as a little kid, I find myself craving for solitude.1 It was one of the only ways to fill myself up with skills and knowledge I need to continue moving forward.2 I had to read a lot.3 I had to learn, practice and keep working.4 I have not forgotten to rest though.5 In fact, I took a whole three months of break from forcing myself to study and work.6 During this time I went back to play and passing time.7
