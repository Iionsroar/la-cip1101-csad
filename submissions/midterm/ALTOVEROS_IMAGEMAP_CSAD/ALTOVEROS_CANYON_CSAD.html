        <h3>The Canyon in the Midst of Sandstone</h3>
        <p>Located in Arizona, Grand Canyon National Park encompasses 277 miles (446 km) of the Colorado River and adjacent uplands. The park is home to much of the immense Grand Canyon; a mile (1.6 km) deep, and up to 18 miles (29 km) wide. Layered bands of colorful rock reveal millions of years of geologic history. Grand Canyon is unmatched in the incomparable vistas it offers visitors from the rim.</p>

        <h3>How to Get There</h3>
        <p>Most visitors to the Grand Canyon fly into Las Vegas or Phoenix. There's also a small airport in Flagstaff, just an hour from the South Rim, and some North Rim travelers fly into Salt Lake City. No matter where you land you'll need to rent a car, as public transit is extremely limited in this part of the U.S.</p>
